# Technologies Used
  - Node.js: Backend server to handle HTTP requests and WebSocket connections.
  
  - Express.js: Framework for building the web server.

  - Socket.io: Library for real-time WebSocket communication.
  
  - Peer.js: WebRTC library for peer-to-peer video streaming.
  
  - EJS: Templating engine for generating HTML pages.
  
  - Bootstrap: CSS framework for styling the frontend.

# How It Works
  1) Landing Page (index.ejs):
  
      Users enter their name and optionally a Room ID.
    
      If no Room ID is provided, a new one is generated using uuidv4().
  
  2) Room Page (room.ejs):
  
      Users are redirected to a room where they can see and communicate with others.
      
      The room supports multiple participants, video streaming, and chat.
      
      Users can mute/unmute their microphone, stop/start their video, and leave the meeting.
  
  3) Server (server.js):
      
      Manages user connections using Socket.io.
      
      Handles room creation and user management.
      
      Broadcasts messages and video streams to other participants in the room.
  
  4) Client-side (script.js):
  
      Establishes a peer-to-peer connection using Peer.js.
    
      Manages video streaming and chat.
    
      Updates the UI based on user actions like muting, unmuting, and leaving the room.
